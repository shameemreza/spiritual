The beauty of building apps with Flutter is that it allows you to build Android and iOS apps all from one codebase. With Flutter, you write code once in Dart, and run it on multiple platforms.

Widgets play an essential role in creating and declaring user interface. Apps designed & developed with Flutter have a transparent UI and provide users with a delightful experience. The goal of this project is to provide an ultimate collection of app's UIs.

While I built Spiritual UI Kit for my own needs, it is also intented to showcase good app structure and a clean, well-organized Flutter codebase.

The source code is **100% Dart**, and everything resides in the [/lib](https://github.com/shameemreza/spiritual/tree/master/lib) folder.
